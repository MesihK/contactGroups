Cath:
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/9/23
Four major levels of CATH are class, architecture, topology and homologous superfamily.
If there is sufficient evidence that a set of domains share a clear common ancestor, they are grouped together into a single homologous superfamily. 
When homologous superfamilies (‘H’ level in CATH) share the same fold, but do not have sufficient evidence to suggest a clear evolutionary relationship, they are placed in the same topology (‘T’ level). 
Topologies that share a roughly similar spatial arrangement of secondary structures are grouped in the same architecture (‘A’ level). 
The 40 architectures in CATH are arranged into one of four main classes (‘C’ level) based on the content of secondary structure (mainly alpha, mainly beta, mixed alpha-beta, few secondary structures).

CATH List File (CLF) Format 2.0
-------------------------------
This file format has an entry for each structural entry in CATH.

Column 1:  CATH domain name (seven characters)
Column 2:  Class number
Column 3:  Architecture number
Column 4:  Topology number
Column 5:  Homologous superfamily number
Column 6:  S35 sequence cluster number
Column 7:  S60 sequence cluster number
Column 8:  S95 sequence cluster number
Column 9:  S100 sequence cluster number
Column 10: S100 sequence count number
Column 11: Domain length
Column 12: Structure resolution (Angstroms)

CATH Domain Names
-----------------
CHARACTERS 1-4: PDB Code
CHARACTER 5: Chain Character
	Chain characters of zero ('0') indicate that the PDB file has no chain field.
